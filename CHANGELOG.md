# Master (becomes Release v0.5)

- Add tensorProduct quadrature rule and [0,1] to [-1,1] transformation ([#238](https://github.com/ikarus-project/ikarus/pull/238))
- Refactored Interface for `calculateAt`-functions and `ResultFunction` by getting rid of `ResultRequirements`
  ([#245](https://github.com/ikarus-project/ikarus/pull/245))
- Refactor `enhancedassumedstrains.hh` ([#247](https://github.com/ikarus-project/ikarus/pull/247))
- add factory functions to `ResultFunction` ([#251](https://github.com/ikarus-project/ikarus/pull/251))
- Refactor `febases` to handle any type of basis ([#256](https://github.com/ikarus-project/ikarus/pull/256))
- Move `autodiffhelper.hh` from `utils` to `autodiff` folder ([#259](https://github.com/ikarus-project/ikarus/pull/259))
- Added a unified, generic interface for `ResultTypes` with the ability to register new
  ones ([#261](https://github.com/ikarus-project/ikarus/pull/261))
- Refactor of FE requirements and non-linear operator construction ([#289](https://github.com/ikarus-project/ikarus/pull/289))
    - The FE requirement type is no longer standalone but is rather dictated by the element.
      Therefore, the elements no longer contain the template argument `FERequirements`.
      It can be obtained statically by `FEType::Requirement` or by getting an object via `fe.createRequirement()`.
    - The exported type by the finite elements is `Requirement` and no longer `FERequirementType`.
    - FE requirements no longer contain affordance information; they now have to be passed separately while calling methods of the assembler.
    - The FE requirements only contain a single solution vector and a single parameter.
    - The getter functions are renamed from `getGlobalSolution` and `getParameter` to `globalSolution` and `parameter`, respectively.
    - The `FErequirements` now have a method `populated` to indicate if the quantities needed by the FE are inserted.
    - The assemblers can now be bound to specific FE requirements, affordances, and an DBCOption.
    - The assemblers now implement a single function `matrix` to assemble matrix quantities.
      Similarly, a single function `vector` is implemented to assemble the corresponding vector quantities.
      Here also, affordance and the `DBCOption` have to be passed.
      The `DBCOption` decides whether a raw, a reduced, or a full matrix is to be obtained.
    - The finite element functions `calculateMatrix`, `calculateVector`, and `calculateScalar` now directly accept the affordances.
    - The affordances are now all singular, `ScalarAffordances` --> `ScalarAffordance`
    - The affordances now know about each other.
      Therefore, calling the function `vectorAffordance(MatrixAffordance::stiffness)` returns `VectorAffordance::forces`.
    - Nonlinear operators can now conveniently be constructed by `NonLinearOperatorFactory`. A bound assembler can be passed to the `op` function,
      but all options can also be passed directly.
    - The linear solver is now fully copyable and moveable.
    - The non-linear solver creation can now be simply done by using the new class `NonlinearSolverFactory`, which receives the settings of
      the non-linear solver and
      adds the function `create`, which accepts a *bound* assembler, where a non-linear operator can be constructed on the fly. For this to
      work, all non-linear solvers have to implement a method `createNonlinearSolver`, which accepts the settings of the class and a nonlinear
      operator. See, e.g., `NewtonRaphsonWithSubsidiaryFunction`.
    - Python:
        - Bindings for Enums can now be done conveniently with the `ENUM_BINDINGS` macro.
        - The finite element functions `calculateMatrix`, `calculateVector`, and `calculateScalar` now directly accept the affordances.
        - The assembler bindings now also accept affordances and `DBCOption`, and they are also renamed to simply `matrix`, `vector`
          and `scalar`.
        - The assemblers also export the binding functions to bind the assemblers.
- Added a new class `AssemblerManipulator` that wraps an existing assembler
  and helps to manipulate the assembled quantities.
  ([#304](https://github.com/ikarus-project/ikarus/pull/304))
    - This can be used, for instance, to apply concentrated forces or to add spring stiffness in a particular direction.
    - Furthermore, a helper function to get the global index of a Lagrange node at the given global position is added.
- Rework the Python Interface for `DirichletValues` plus add support to easily fix boundary DOFs of `Subspacebasis` in C++ and Python ([#305](https://github.com/ikarus-project/ikarus/pull/305))
- Add a truss element ([#302](https://github.com/ikarus-project/ikarus/pull/302))
- Add an About Ikarus page in the documentation ([#291](https://github.com/ikarus-project/ikarus/pull/291))
