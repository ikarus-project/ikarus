# Welcome to the documentation of Ikarus
Ikarus is a finite element software originated at the [Institute for Structural Mechanics](https://www.ibb.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) at the university of Stuttgart.

This project tries to provide an easy to read and an easy to use finite element framework.
It is heavily inspired by the finite element software [DUNE](https://dune-project.org/), the book [DUNE â€” The Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030597016),
[deal.II](https://www.dealii.org/) and [Kratos](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos).
Furthermore it directly used several modules from [DUNE](https://dune-project.org/).

We favor value semantics and readability.

Concerning the design of CI and the documentation we were inspired by [Autodiff](https://autodiff.github.io/)  and [Kratos](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos).

The documentation is build using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
