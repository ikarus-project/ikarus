# Welcome to the documentation of Ikarus
Ikarus is a finite element software program that originated at the [Institute for Structural Mechanics](https://www.ibb.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) at the University of Stuttgart.

This project tries to provide an easy-to-read and an easy-to-use finite element framework.
It is heavily inspired by the finite element software [DUNE](https://dune-project.org/), the book [DUNE â€” The Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030597016),
[deal.II](https://www.dealii.org/) and [Kratos](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos).
Furthermore, it directly uses several modules from [DUNE](https://dune-project.org/).

The design of CI and the documentation were inspired by [Autodiff](https://autodiff.github.io/)  and [Kratos](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos).

The documentation is built using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
