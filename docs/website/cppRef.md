# C++ recommendations
As you may know by now Ikarus is written in C++. On this page we summerize recommendation to dig deeper into C++ coding.

### Should i write a member function or a free- function?
Scott Meyers recommends the following algorithm: [Link](http://cpptips.com/nmemfunc_encap)

### When to use const?
1. [Arthur O'Dwyer blog](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2022/01/23/dont-const-all-the-things/)

### How should i pass my parameters to a function and return from a function?
1. [Herb Sutter Cppcon Talk 2014](https://youtu.be/xnqTKD8uD64?t=3318)

## Best practices

1. [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) (A lot to learn there and you can just search some topic.)
2. [Jason Turner's collection of best practices](https://lefticus.gitbooks.io/cpp-best-practices)
3. [More C++ idioms](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms)

## Further references

1. [Cppcon Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon) These videos are released after every conference. For beginners the Back to basics track can be recommended.
2. [Godblot](https://godbolt.org/) Online compiler with assembler output. Nice to test fast if something would be fast or slow. 
Also Eigen can be added. Also any other header found on the internet can be include with the link.
