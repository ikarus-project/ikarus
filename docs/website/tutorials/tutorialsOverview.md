# Tutorials

This section explains the practical use of several parts and provides examples
that you can use as a starting point for your work. It does not describe the
impl theory.

 
of various parts of the code. It is dedicated to users who want to extend
or modifiy the implemented functionality or who want to learn more about 
the impl thoughts and theoretical aspects.

If you are rather interested in the theoretical background 
and implementation details, visit the
