  <figcaption>Micromagnetostatic simulation with magnetization \( \boldsymbol{m} \in \mathcal{S}^{2}  \) and the magnetic vector potential
\( \boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^3 \). Inside the sphere the free field is discretized and in the center a thin cylindrical magnetic material is place.
 The B-Field magnitude is indicated by the color. Furthermore, the magnetization vectors inside the magnetic material are shown which indicate the curling mode of the magnet.
